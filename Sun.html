                The Sun is the primary source of energy for life on Earth. It is the closest star to the Earth, about
                150 million kilometers from Earth. <br>The temperature of the Sun’s visible surface (photosphere) is
                about 6000 degrees Celsius. <br>However, the outer layer of the Sun’s atmosphere, known as the Corona,
                is, on average, about 2 million degrees Celsius. <br>The core of the Sun is the center and is about 15
                million degrees Celsius.<br><br>
                The Sun is made up of 73% hydrogen and 25% helium. It also has trace amounts of oxygen, carbon, iron,
                and other elements. <br>It is classified as a G-Type Main Sequence Star. It is about 4.6 billion years
                old and will continue to shine for another 5 billion years.<br> After that, it will grow into a Red
                Giant and then finally end its life as a white dwarf.
